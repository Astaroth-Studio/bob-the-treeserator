# Bob The Tree-serator
Bob's gone f**ing mad and wants to plant trees everywhere, even in men in black faces.

## Synopsis
Bob was a simple man, living in a simple crib, when one day, he discovered that all the trees were gone! Furious, he grabbed a floppy disk that was lying around in the trash and threw it. When it touched the ground, a tree grew out of the ground right were the floppy disk was planted! It was at this moment that Bob decided it was enough. With theses, he will going to populate all of the deserted region with trees like it was before the Mens in Black came in (yes, there are mens in black). And it's going to sh** bricks.

## What is this Git repository?
It's the project of the game with everything you need to compile it with GameMaker Studio. It was done with the version 1.4.9999 so we don't know if it works with GMS2. It's also used for participating in the GitHub's Game Jam 2018 on itch.io (https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018).
